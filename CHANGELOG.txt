V2.0.3
- Fix issue where arrivals were distance filtered from entire database.
  They should only be removed from inversion/kde/meshing
- Update LINEAR weighting logic
- Lower track_residual_improvement cutoff to -1%, skip event check for 1st iteration
- Adjust events/arrivals KDE weight scheme

V2.0.2
- Add solver weighting scheme based on arrival residual (user adjustable)
- Add params/options for model update via realizations stacking (user adjustable)
- Reduce default vertical res test smoothing to 2*dz
- Make default "safe residual" to mean-std rather than hardwired value

V2.0.1
- Move some CLI arguments to config file (breaking change!)
- Require PyKonal 0.5 (non-standard; see below)
- Added an expanded test dataset (now with both phases!) for original SoCal example
- Adaptive meshing: Add config parameter to weigh raypath density vs horizontal gradient
- Countless minor edits I can't remember
- Starting to pay better attention to changelog

V2.0.0
- Added automatic "checkerboard" model generation & resolution testing
- Added ability to perform joint teleseismic inversions
- Added adaptive meshing 
- Added "source_id" to events to track for external QC-
  poor performing events/arrivals automatically removed and logged
- Expand parameter features & abilities
- Expanded LSMR information and iterative solution logging
- Automatic LSMR damping calculator 
- Interpret model variance in km/s
- Handle water/land velocity model boundaries better
- Added flexibility with restarting or skipping phases
- Additional QC to track and remove bad events/arrivals
- New plotting and catalog generation scripts
- Added synthetic test datasets & scripts
- Various speed improvements & updated dependencies

*** 

PyKonal (0.5.0) - https://github.com/filefolder/pykonal_0.5
Note that PyVoroTomo >= 2.0.0 requires PyKonal 0.5

- numpy 2.0 infinity bug
- few other saftey catches, glitch fixes, and speedups I have found useful for PyVoroTomo
